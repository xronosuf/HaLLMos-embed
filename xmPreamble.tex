%%  Define extra macro's
%%  Be careful with layout-macro's:
%%    - they might not work/confuse the HTML version
%%    - if needed, they could be put in xmPrintStyle.sty

\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}

% This is a rather very advanced example of using TeX-functionality
%  First-time users should just skip reading this.
%  When using this xmPreamble for your own repo,
%  remove this section, UNLESS YOU WANT pre-2025-OSU versions of hints and expandables
%  If so, KEEP ONLY the two lines with \def\xmNot....
%
%  With this code fragment, one gets BY DEFAULT OSU-style hints.
%  UNLESS the filename contains the string 'Variant', 
%         when one gets the newer expandable hints. 
%  Once the OSU server gets updated, all this will become obsolete.
