    A HaLLMos Embed Attempted Demo

\maketitle

\textbf{Note:} The actual name of the command and/or environments are just placeholders, 
pending a conversation about the ``correct'' intuitive ones to use.

Because of the way that the html of the script version is embedded, 
it turns out that we can probably do either a command version; \verb|\hallmos[Instructor Notes]{Problem Statement}|
or (because the problem statement is its own line in the html embed) we can do an environment version;
\verb|\begin{hallmos}[Instructor Notes] Problem Statement \end{hallmos}|

Here is the command version, which is literally written as:
\verb|\hallmos[]{Suppose the number $n$ is even. Prove that $n+1$ is odd.}|

\hallmos[]{Suppose the number $n$ is even. Prove that $n+1$ is odd.}


Here is the environment version, which is literally written as:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
Suppose that $n$ is odd. Prove that $n+1$ is even.
\end{hallmosEnv}
\end{verbatim}


\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
Suppose that $n$ is odd. Prove that $n+1$ is even.
\end{hallmosEnv}



Hopefully everything works!%
