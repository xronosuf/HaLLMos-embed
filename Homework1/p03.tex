\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x^n = y^n$, then $|x| = |y|$.
\end{hallmosEnv}
Hint: Break this into two cases, where $n$ is even, and $n$ is odd.


Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
