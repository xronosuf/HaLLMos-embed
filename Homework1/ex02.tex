    Extension Problem 2 for Homework 1
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The extension problem list is not homework that will be collected or graded (unless you want feedback from me - in which case you should email me, or talk to me before/after class). These are problems that encompass important ideas and/or common constructions/proof-techniques used in future analytic classes (e.g. graduate courses, specialized applications in engineering, physics, etc...). I include them here for those interested in pushing a little further on the topics from this section.

This problem demonstrates one of the classic proof techniques which will definitely come up later - 
controling the sum of two sources of error.

\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    Let $\epsilon>0$ be a (small) positive real number, and fix $x_0,y_0\in\R$. If $|x-x_0|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$, and $|y-y_0|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$, then
    \[
        |(x + y) - (x_0 + y_0)| < \epsilon
    \]
    And
    \[
        |(x - y) - (x_0 - y_0)| < \epsilon
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}
