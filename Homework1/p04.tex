\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    Find all numbers (and prove they are all such numbers) $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that:
    \[
        \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} > 0
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}

Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
