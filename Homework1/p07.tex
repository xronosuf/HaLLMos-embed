Hint: Use cases and work this out (carefully!) step by step to avoid mistakes. 


Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
