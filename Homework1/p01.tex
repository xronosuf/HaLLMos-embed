    Fix $a\in\R$. Then, if $a\neq 0$ and $ax = x$ for all $x\in\R$, then $a = 1$.

Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
