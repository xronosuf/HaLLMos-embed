    Let $a$ and $b$ be positive real numbers, i.e. $0 < a < b$. Then 
    \[
        a < \sqrt{ab} < \frac{a+b}{2} < b
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}
Hint: The first and last inequalities should be very straight forward to prove, the middle one is the tricky one. For the middle one, recall that, for any $x\in\R$, $x^2 \geq 0$, and this inequality is strict if $x$ is non-zero.


Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
