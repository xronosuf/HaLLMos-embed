    Extension Problem 3 for Homework 1
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The extension problem list is not homework that will be collected or graded (unless you want feedback from me - in which case you should email me, or talk to me before/after class). These are problems that encompass important ideas and/or common constructions/proof-techniques used in future analytic classes (e.g. graduate courses, specialized applications in engineering, physics, etc...). I include them here for those interested in pushing a little further on the topics from this section.

This problem demonstrates one of the classic proof techniques which will definitely come up later - 
controling against two \emph{different} sources of error simultaneously.

\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    Let $\epsilon>0$ be a (small) positive real number, and fix $x_0,y_0\in\R$. 
    If $|x - x_0|<\min\left(\frac{\epsilon}{2(|y_0|+1)},1\right)$, 
    and $|y - y_0|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(|x_0|+1)}$, then
    \[
        |xy - x_0y_0| < \epsilon
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}

Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
