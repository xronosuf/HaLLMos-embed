\maketitle

This problem aims to prove the \textbf{Reverse Triangle Inequality};

\begin{theorem}[Reverse Triangle Inequality]
    For all $x,y\in\R$,
    \[
        | ( |x| - |y|) | \leq |x-y|
    \]
\end{theorem}

To make this slightly easier we break it up into two steps, outlined via HaLLMos below:

\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    For every $x,y\in\R$,
    \[
        |x - y| \leq |x| + |y|
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}

Note: The proof of the above should be pretty short and straight forward

\begin{hallmosEnv}[]
    For every $x,y\in\R$,
    \[
        |x| - |y| \leq |x - y|
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}

Combine the two statements above to conclude the reverse triangle inequality. \\

Note: For your actual homework problem, you can write one proof - for the reverse triangle inequality - where the proof is comprised of the two proofs above, along with a statement at the end tying them together to conclude your result.

Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
