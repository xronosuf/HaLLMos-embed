    Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers. Then we can express the maximum of $x$ and $y$ as follows;
    \[
        \max(x,y) = \frac{x + y + |y - x|}{2}
    \]
    Use the above result to also prove that
    \[
        \min(x,y) = \frac{x + y - |y - x|}{2}
    \]
\end{hallmosEnv}

Hint: This second question is a corollary of the first quesiton; it should only require a one-line proof (although HaLLMos may not recognize that you have proved the first statement in its feedback).


Remember HaLLMos is an a.i. model that is intended to give helpful feedback on your proof, in terms of validity (structural correctness) and completeness. However, it is \textit{just} an a.i. model and may not always be correct. HaLLMos should be used to verify what you think is a finished/valid proof, but if you ever have any uncertainty or questions about your proof or the problem itself, you should definitely contact your instructor to get clarification and assistance.
